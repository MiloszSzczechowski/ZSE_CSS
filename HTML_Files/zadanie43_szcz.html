        High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less bound to
        the underlying hardware.
        <b>The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was developed in 1952 by Grace Hopper, who also coined the
            term 'compiler'.
            FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957 and
            many other languages were soon developedâ€”in particular.</b>
        COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.
    </p>

    <p>
        Programs were mostly entered using punched cards or paper tape.
        <b>A typing error generally necessitated re-punching an entire card.
            By the late 1960s, data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could
            be created by typing directly into the computers.</b>
        Text editors were also developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with
        punched cards.

        Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. The
        following properties are among the most important:
        <ul>
            <li>Reliability: how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of
                algorithms and minimization of programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g.,
                buffer overflows and race conditions) and logic errors (such as division by zero or off-by-one errors).
            </li>
            <li>Robustness: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes situations
                such as incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory,
                operating system services, and network connections, user error, and unexpected power outages</li>
            <li>Usability: the ergonomics of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its
                intended purpose or in some cases even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success
                even regardless of other issues. This involves a wide range of textual, graphical, and sometimes
                hardware elements that improve the clarity, intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's
                user interface.
            </li>
            <li>Portability: the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on which the source code of a
                program can be compiled/interpreted and run. This depends on differences in the programming facilities
                provided by the different platforms, including hardware and operating system resources, expected
                behavior of the hardware and operating system, and availability of platform-specific compilers (and
                sometimes libraries) for the language of the source code.
                -</li>
